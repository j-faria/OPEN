import logging


# The following code extends Python's logging module with a custom log level
# called VERBOSE. 
# This log level sits between the predefined INFO and DEBUG levels and is used 
# to convey "detailed information that should be understandable to experienced 
# users to provide insight in the software's behavior; a sort of high level 
# debugging information".
# According the logging documentation this is not ideal but I found OPEN did in
# fact need this aditional level.

# Define the numeric value and label of the verbose level.
