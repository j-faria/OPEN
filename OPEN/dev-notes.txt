Testing plot performance: Matplotlib .vs. Pyqtgraph
***************************************************

Periodogram, just calculation: 
	1st time -> CPU times: user 0.52 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.53 s
				Wall time: 0.53 s

	2nd time -> CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
				Wall time: 0.00 s


Periodogram, calculation + Matplotlib plot:
	1st time -> CPU times: user 1.67 s, sys: 0.54 s, total: 2.21 s
				Wall time: 8.31 s

	2nd time -> CPU times: user 0.86 s, sys: 0.74 s, total: 1.60 s
				Wall time: 8.17 s

Periodogram, calculation + Pyqtgraph plot:
	1st time -> CPU times: user 1.20 s, sys: 0.23 s, total: 1.43 s
				Wall time: 9.63 s

	2nd time -> CPU times: user 0.12 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.13 s
				Wall time: 7.93 s


	

	RESULTS FROM PERFORMANCE TEST:
	******************************

			2nd time call takes virtually no time without plotting, 
			so it's safe to say all time is spent doing the plots
			
			Matplotlib: 0.86, 0.74, 1.60
			Pyqtgraph : 0.12. 0.01, 0.13 <--- we can see the winner

	Discussion: are we really plotting the same things??
